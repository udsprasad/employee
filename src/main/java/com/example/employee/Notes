1) Spring components
2) different Scopes
3) Bean lifeCycle
4) different type of ApplicationContext
5) prototype in singleton scope
6) Autowired
7) Autowired types
8) concurrent API
9) Try resource
10) Transactional
11) Import vs ComponentScan
12) Qualifier vs Primary
13)I believe @ElementCollection is mainly for mapping non-entities (embeddable or basic) while @OneToMany is used to map entities.
So which one to use depend on what you want to achieve.
