question 1:
        int[] array1 ={1,2,3,4};
        int[] array2 = new int[5];
        for(int i=0;i<array1.length;i++){
            array2[i]=array1[i];
        }
        System.out.println(array2[4]);

solution is zero

question 2:
      List<Map<String,String>> list = new ArrayList<>();// line 1
            list.add(new HashMap<>()); // line 2
            Map<?,?> map = list.get(0); // line 3
            map.put("key","value"); //line 4

solution : you will get the error in line 4 bcz in line three you define map with ?


question 3 :  A stream pipeline consists of a source
(which might be an array, a collection, a generator function, an I/O channel, etc);

question 4:  List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(2,4,6,7,8);
                  list.stream().allMatch(i->{
                      System.out.println(i);
                      return i%2 ==0;
                  });

solution is {2, 4 ,6 ,7}

question 5: 3l 5l jars are there with using these two jar you need to calculate 4litres-> no measurements
answer: step1  fill 3l jar
        step2  pour water from 3l jar into 5l jar  -> 5l jar filled with 3ls of water
        step3  now again fill the 3l jar
        step4  pour water from 3l jar into 5l jar -> now 5l jar will be filled and 1 litre will be left in 3l jar
        step5  now empty the 5l jar
        step6  pour 1litre water which is left in 3l jar to 5l jar
        step7 fill the 3l jar again and transfer to 5l jar now you will get 4 litres in 5l jar

question 6:   //difference in density length thinkness in both wires but burn time is 30 mins -each wire
              //burn both in 45 mins how is possible?

              How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires,
              each of which takes an hour to burn. We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn non-uniformly.
              So, for example, the two halves of a wire might burn in 10 min and 50 min respectively?

answer:  Simultaneously burn both ends of one rod and one end the other rod

question 7 : double-checked locking pattern in singleton?

answer: public static DclSingleton getInstance() {
                if (instance == null) {
                    synchronized (DclSingleton .class) {
                        if (instance == null) {
                            instance = new DclSingleton();
                        }
                    }
                }
                return instance;
            }

question 8: Atomic variables -Atomic Integer
answer : AtomicInteger uses combination of volatile & CAS (compare and swap) to achieve thread-safety
        for Integer Counter.It is non-blocking in nature and thus highly usable in writing high
         throughput concurrent data structures that can be used under low to moderate thread contention.

question 9: Composition is a strong type of "has-a" relationship because the containing object is
           its owner. So, objects are tightly coupled,
           which means if we delete the parent object, the child object will also get deleted with it.
           ex:
           Person with address

           Aggregation relationship is also a "has-a" relationship. The only difference between
           Aggregation and Composition is that in Aggregation, objects are not tightly coupled or
           don't involve owning. All the objects are independent of each other and can exist even
           if the parent object gets deleted

           ex:
           car with wheel
