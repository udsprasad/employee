The local variables do not have any default values in Java.
This means that they can be declared and assigned a value before the variables are
used for the first time, otherwise, the compiler throws an error.

when we will get out of memory error
  An easy way to solve OutOfMemoryError in java is to increase the maximum heap size by using JVM options "-Xmx512M",
  this will immediately solve your OutOfMemoryError.

can we override static methods - learn overhiding concept

in streams foreach is possible with break

question max value in the array should equals to remaining elements
int a[] = {10,30,100,40,20};
     int max =a[0],sum=0;
     for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){
         if(max<a[i]){
             max=a[i];
         }
         sum+=a[i];
     }
     if(sum-max==max){
         System.out.println(true);
     }
